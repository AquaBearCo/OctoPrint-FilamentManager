# OctoPrint-FilamentManager

This OctoPrint plugin helps to manage your filament spools. The project is still under heavy development. So don't rely on it and use it at your own risk. I'm grateful for all reports that help me to track down bugs.

If you have questions or encounter issues please take a look at the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/malnvenshorn/OctoPrint-FilamentManager/wiki#faq) first. There might be already an answer. In case you haven't found what you are looking for, feel free to open a [ticket](https://github.com/malnvenshorn/OctoPrint-FilamentManager/issues/new) and I'll try to help.

* Replacing filament volume with weight in sidebar
* Filament odometer to keep track of remaining filament on spool
* Warn if print exceeds remaining filament on spool
