# OctoPrint-FilamentManager

This OctoPrint plugin helps to manage your filament spools. The project is still under heavy development. So don't rely on it and use it at your own risk. I'm grateful for all reports that help me to track down bugs.

## Features (planned)

* Track filament consumption (incl. multiple extruders)
* Warn if print exceeds remaining filament on spool
* Provide an API for other plugins
