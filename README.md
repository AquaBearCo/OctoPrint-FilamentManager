# OctoPrint-FilamentManager

This OctoPrint plugin helps to manage your filament spools. The project is still under heavy development. So don't rely on it and use it at your own risk. I'm grateful for all reports that help me to track down bugs.

## Additional features

* Replacing filament volume with weight in sidebar
* Filament odometer to keep track of remaining filament on spool
* Enable warning if print exceeds remaining filament on spool
